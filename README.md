## Project Description

This project aims to provide a solution for some management difficulties of a zoo. By using our project, the manager of a zoo can achieve those functionalities with some simple clicks:
1. The Zoo manager can project the general information of the customer and employees. The projection on the animal info is also achieved. (Selection & Projection)

2. This system can show the schedule of the animal shows together with its location name on a selected date. (Join)

3. The manager can add new employees to the system. (Insert)

4. The status of the breeder can also be alternated using this system (if the breeder
change to another position in the zoo). (Update)

5. Removing animals that no longer live in this zoo. (Delete)

6. This system also analyzes the population of each species in this zoo. (Aggregation
with Group by)

7. By checking which shows have a profit above or below the average profit in the
system, the manager can optimize the schedule for shows and achieve a higher
income target. (Nested Aggregation with Group by)

8. The manager may also use the project to see which animal is sick most often in each
living space. (Aggregation with Having)

9. Additional related stats for the animal that see all the doctor (still working) are also
shown on the page. (Division)

Our project not only accomplished the above functionalities. It also has a clear, user-friendly GUI that makes sure the zoo manager (user) can use it without any knowledge of the database.
